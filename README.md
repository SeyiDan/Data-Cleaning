# SQL Project: Data Cleaning
## Overview

This SQL project is designed to clean and standardize a dataset related to layoffs in 2022, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes information about companies, industries, locations, and details of layoffs such as the number of employees laid off and the percentage of the workforce affected.

## Dataset Source
- **Dataset Name:** Layoffs 2022
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)

## Steps in Data Cleaning

### 1. Remove Duplicates

- **Purpose:** Ensure each entry is unique based on specific criteria.
- **Criteria:** Company, industry, total laid off, percentage laid off, date, stage, country, funds raised.
- **Method:**
  1. Create a staging table (`layoffs_staging`) to avoid modifying the original data.
  2. Use `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY` to identify duplicate rows.
  3. Delete rows with `row_num > 1`.

### 2. Standardize the Data

- **Purpose:** Normalize data formats for consistency.
- **Actions:**
  - Trim company names to remove leading/trailing spaces.
  - Standardize industry names (e.g., "crypto" to "Crypto").
  - Trim trailing dots from country names.
  - Convert date strings to a standard date format using `STR_TO_DATE`.

### 3. Handle Null or Blank Values

- **Purpose:** Replace or remove null/blank values where possible.
- **Actions:**
  - Identify rows with null `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off`.
  - Update null industry values with non-null values from matching companies.
  - Remove rows with both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` as null.

### 4. Remove Unnecessary Rows and Columns

- **Purpose:** Streamline the dataset by removing redundant or unnecessary data.
- **Actions:**
  - Delete rows where both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` are null.
  - Drop the `row_num` column after duplicate removal.

## Usage

1. Clone the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Execute the SQL scripts in sequence to clean and standardize the data.
3. Use the cleaned dataset (`layoffs_staging2`) for further analysis.
